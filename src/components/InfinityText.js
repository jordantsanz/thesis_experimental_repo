const textArray = ['In this experiment, you will be taught drum music notation. You will learn note lengths and different drums.',

  ' For each lesson, you will learn either a new note, a new instrument, or learn at a faster tempo (Tempo is just the speed at which the music is played).',

  'During each activity in the lesson, you will play instruments using the keys on your keyboard. Your accuracy and your timing will be measured.',

  `
During these activities, the next note to play will be highlighted in blue.
Notes that are played on time and with the right instrument will be highlighted in green. Notes that are played with the incorrect
instrument or too early or late will be highlighted in red.
`,

  `
For each activity, you will have the option to Listen or Start the activity. Listening will play the activity for you once first, and starting the activity will start your attempt.
There is no penalty for listening first.
`,

  `
When the activity starts, a metronome will count out four beats first. Then, you will play along to the metronome.`,

  quarter note will correspond to one beat (you'll learn what a quarter note is later.)`,

  '                  Each lesson is taught on the percussion clef, as per drum notation.',
